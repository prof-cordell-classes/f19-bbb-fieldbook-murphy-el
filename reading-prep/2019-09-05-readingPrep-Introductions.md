# Reading Prep: WEEK 1

#### Elaina Murphy

## Questions/Observations

1. How does the Liu piece emphasize the fact that bookmaking isnâ€™t limited to the codex? 
2. I love that each species' bookmaking habits are things we already do--making records, creating neural pathways, coding computers to make decisions, etc.
3. What *do* our oldest books say about us?  
4. Price said that all books, not just ebooks, are not real--thoughts on this?
