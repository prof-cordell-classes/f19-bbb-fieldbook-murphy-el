## Questions and Thoughts

1. I think the comparison between movies and music to books in the technology era is really interesting. Almost everyone listens to music and watches shows/movies through some sort of steaming service where you don't own the media but still have access. Will books follow a similar path as e-;it becomes more ubiquitous?
2. I always think it's interesting to read about how critics in the past had many of the same concerns about technology that people have today. Everyone always fears change, but often these new technologies make us able to do things we couldn't before. Are there any developments that have made our overall thinking and problem solving abilities worse over time?
3. Bois story is very cool but I'm still very confused as to what is going on. Could this story have existed in some capacity in a codex?
