# Reflection: Zines

#### Elaina Murphy

## Questions

1. How can you not just *make* art, but *be* art like Pagan said she and the Underground artists like her were. Can we all be art in our own way, even if others see us as ordinary?
2. I think it's interesting that 'zine publications require specific rules as they are self-published and personal and not mass published like most books.
3. How do the concepts of linearity and non-linearity interact in Traces?
