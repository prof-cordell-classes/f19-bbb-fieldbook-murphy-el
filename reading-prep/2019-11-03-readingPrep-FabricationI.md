# Week 9 - Fabrication I: 3D Printing

#### Elaina Murphy

## Questions and Thoughts

1. I never thought about Arduino and Lego as rapid prototype decides, but they definitely are. They allow for much faster fabrication than starting from scratch to build a system/object. Using them isn't always the fastest process (I've worked on Arduino projects for weeks) but neither are CNC machines--you need to take time to design your prototype before you fabricate it and even then the process is not instantaneous. 
2. For the 3D printed book, I don't understand how it will all be printed in one go. You can't print each page directly on top of the next because they'll fuse and you can't put spacers in because then you'll just be printing into thin air. Also the way the process is described you need a bed of powder, meaning you can only print one page which would then have to be moved to print the next. If you move the page then each is being printed individually, not all at once like Arad claims.
3. Who is making the projects for *Making Things and Drawing Boundaries*? I was doubting whether the mic jammer would actually work to mute your microphone and was wondering what the qualifications were for a project to be featured in this book/website. 
4. Are the featured projects books? Most of them I feel like are not, but some of them remind me of the things described from *The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species* article we read at the beginning of the year.
