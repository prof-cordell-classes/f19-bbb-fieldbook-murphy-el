# Reading Prep: Print II

#### Elaina Murphy

## Thoughts

1. How do letter styles reflect a changing use for print?
2. I never realized that paragraphs don't really exist in speaking and are unique to writing.
3. Fonts are so ingrained into our culture that by just looking through different options you know what each would be used for.
