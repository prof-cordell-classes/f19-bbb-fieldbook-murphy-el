# Reading Prep: WHAT IS A BOOK?

#### Elaina Murphy

## Questions

1. Does the form do more to affect the function of books or does the function do more to affect the form?  
2. Is a book anything that contains knowledge, or is it narrower than that?
3. Was reading better in the past, or is it all just over-romanticized hyperbole?
4. How long until the codex becomes obsolete--will nostalgia keep it around for longer?
