# Week 10 - Fabrication II: 3D Paper Circuits

#### Elaina Murphy

## Questions and Thoughts

1. Can bringing too many components into a book make it less accessible? I always thought that part of the point of books was to make the story the author is trying to tell available to the public, but I guess that's not always the case. This question came from the Bibliocircuitry* reading when Lear says his poem is  "Neither born-digital
nor digitized â€” nor yet entirely paper-based." He says it inhabits a hybrid space which leads me to wonder how I would ever get a copy of this book.

2. The *Thinking as Handwork* article mentioned using 3D printing to make museum exhibits more interactive. I was thinking of the ivory tusk they mentioned at the beginning of the article. Although it would be cool to touch museum exhibits. the fact that they are replicas I feel takes away a lot of the reasons I personally would want to touch a museum exhibit.
3. I was thinking of paper circuits as exactly that--circuits set in paper (I've seen videos of conductive markers that allow you to draw a circuit on a piece of paper). But now I'm wondering if the week's theme meant something simply referred to fabricating books in unique ways. A circuit can refer generally to a connection or loop, which is an interesting way to think of a books--as a way to access a specific circuit in the brain.
