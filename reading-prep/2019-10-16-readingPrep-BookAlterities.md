# Week 7 - Book Alterities

## Questions and Thoughts

1. I really like Ulises Carrion's thought on books as space-time objects, it was one of the quotes I was considering highlighting in my book report. I also think it's interesting that in the past authors only thought about the text, but now authors usually think about both the text and the book itself--what does it say that we are reading his book online instead of in the form that he made it to be published in?
2. Bok's work to make something that will last forever is very interesting. He realizes that material objects will only be around to share his work for so long, but this bacteria can live through most catastrophes to keep spreading his poem. How else can we record information that will outlast human life?
3. I was describing the Future Library project to a friend and he said "I don't even like reading but I want to read these books now that I know I'm not allowed to." How does the mystery of the unread manuscripts give them more power? Will people still care about them in 100 years?
